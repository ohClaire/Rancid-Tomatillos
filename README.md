## Overview

This was a paired collaboration assigned in week 14 of the Turing School of Software and Design front-end engineering program. The goals of this group project were to:

* Gain competency with React fundamentals
* Create a multi-page UX using Router
* Test React components & asynchronous JS with Cypress
* Practicing refactoring 

## Features:

* Search bar at the top right corner of the page to filter through movies using iterator methods
* Used React Router to change views from main page and movie details page
* Made network requests to a RESTful API for data on our movie details and preview videos.
* Tested the different browser pages with Cypress, while also stubbing and intercepting network requests.
* Accessibility: app is fully _tabbable_, and scored 100% on both Lighthouse and WAVE audits
* Loading page has an animated rolling tomato

## GETTING STARTED

### Installation
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
1. Fork this Repo
2. Clone it down to your machine
3. cd into the root of the project directory
4. Run `npm install`
5. To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal to start the local server. This runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
6. Open your favorite code editor and go to the `package.json` file to check that you have installed the required dependencies: `react-router-dom`, `react-youtube`, `@u-wave/react-vimeo`
6. See the section about [deployment](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/) for more information.
7. Enter `Ctrl + C` in your terminal to stop the local server at any time.

### Testing
This project was tested with [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#Installing)
1. cd into this project
2. Run `npm run cypress`

## Wins and Challenges

### Wins 
* Learning React Router 
* Cypress E2E testing
* Displaying the preview videos using third-party libraries
* Error handling messages 

### Challenges 
* Intercepting and stubbing in Cypress. 

### Future Directions
* Some of our movie details page has extra space between our preview videos and movie details. We would like to make this page more responsive so the extra space only occurs when the page size is too small to fit the grid display.
